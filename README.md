Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning Project Overview: This project aims to detect breast cancer using machine learning. The solution consists of a Flutter frontend (mobile app), a Flask backend (connecting Flutter to Python code), and a Jupyter Notebook for training and testing the machine learning model.

Technologies: Flutter: Mobile app frontend. Flask: Backend API to connect Flutter with the machine learning model. Jupyter Notebook: Python code for training the breast cancer detection model using machine learning. Project Structure: flutter_app/: Contains the Flutter code for the mobile app. flask_api/: Contains the Flask backend code to handle API requests. notebooks/: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the machine learning code for breast cancer detection.
